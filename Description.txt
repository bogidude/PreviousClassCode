This program accepts a graph input as shown in the dags folder and uses them as processes that need to be done.
Each process must wait for the one before it to finish before it can be done. The program calculates the minimum
number of steps required to finish all the processes and if "-s #NUMBER#" is typed after the filename, the program will 
assume that only #NUMBER# steps can be done at one time and produces a schedule that tries to minimize the
number of steps needed.
